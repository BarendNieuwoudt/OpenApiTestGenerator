# OpenApiTestGenerator
A tool that will generate unit tests given a spec.

This tool doesnt work, at all, but it will someday (hopefully)

Currently, it can:
- Load a Yaml File into a dictionary
- Find objects in the dictionary by their name
- Load the template file
- Output the template file with some variables replaced by their value in the spec
